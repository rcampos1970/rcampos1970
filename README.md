- 👋 Hi, I’m @rcampos1970, currently 16 years old, I live in Brazil and like to code and do Arduino projects. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, what may be my carrier path. I like C, Python and Web coding. I am also interested in Mechanical Engeneering, 
- and Mechatronics (and Arduino too!).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Object Oriented programming, and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects, so I can excel my abilities and also master my english.
- 📫 How to reach me (I am afraid that may turn out to be impossible)
